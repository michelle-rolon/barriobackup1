            <p>Classified as one of the first suburbs to exist in the outskirts of the Los Angeles area, Lincoln Heights holds notable and conserved history of its beginning and current identification as a suburb. Lincoln Heights represented the ideal suburban utopia of the early eighteenth century Angeleno. It has traditional Victorian architecture, wide open spaces for parks and lakes, and leisure activities located in the neighborhood. Through out the years this community has continued forth as a suburb, but it has been reshaped by various groups, including Chican@ and Latin@ urbanism. Chican@ and Latin@ presence has brought forth major community change with the outbreak of the Chican@ Movement during the 1970â€™s. Iconic symbols of relevance from the time period can be noticed through the facets of the arts and education. Overall, racial and cultural factors continue to compile and keep Lincoln Heights alive.</p>
